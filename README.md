Use Pocket (Read it later) in a corporate environment

A WPF/PRISM/C#/NET4.0 app to allow managing your Pocket(formerly Read It Later) [http://getPocket.com/] reading list.

Even though the browser plugins are great, at work the browsers are locked down / are IE - so Tasche@work was born.

Tasche@Work is a simple and easy way to manage your Pocket list when you can't use the plugins.
